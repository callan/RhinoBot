
This is an old project of mine (from 2005) which was my first experimentation with Java.
During those times Java just recently came out with 1.5.0, Rhino wasn't part of the language,
and GIT was never around (my how times change!)

This is under the BSD license at the moment (see LICENSE.txt) and has very archaic, questionable, and
probably very improper methods of doing things. I'll be working on a new branch (called fresh) that will
hopefully give this some proper love with properness.

If you'd like to help contribute to this project please e-mail me at chris@geartech.org
