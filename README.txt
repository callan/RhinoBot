
This is the "fresh" branch which hopefully has a more coherent layout and organization of the project.
As this is not even alpha things will change dramatically quite often, especially considering some of the
poor state of the code.  Stay Tuned.

This is an old project of mine (from 2005) which was my first experimentation with Java.
During those times Java just recently came out with 1.5.0, Rhino wasn't part of the language,
and GIT was never around (my how times change!)

This is under the BSD license at the moment (see LICENSE.txt) and has very archaic, questionable, and
probably very improper methods of doing things. I'll be working on a new branch (called fresh) that will
hopefully give this some proper love with properness.
